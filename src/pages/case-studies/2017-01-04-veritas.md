Annual Summer Event

We were asked to support VERITAS deliver their annual summer event for 262 adults and children.

Their 'EGG-stravaganza' event earlier in the year had been a huge success and employee expectations were high.

### We needed a theme...

We needed a theme, so we started off as we always do, at the end - what is this event designed to achieve? As with most family fun days, it was all about the children, we were looking for something to ensure they had a fantastic day.

The proposed theme was a Circus event; stilt walkers and jugglers, balloon makers and face painting. A ringmaster, a unicycle and even a tiger, elephant and lion.

### ... and plenty of entertainment ...

We brought in circus games for the children including hook a duck, ping pong toss, tin can alley and ring toss as well as an arts and craft station for the toddlers.

Toffee apples, candy floss, pic 'n' pix and a hog roast mean that no-one went hungry and when the magic show started, the 177 parents had a welcome break as all 87 children gathered in the big top.

Face painting, balloon making and giveaway goodie bags with circus themed toys meant smiling happy faces and a lasting memory of the day.
