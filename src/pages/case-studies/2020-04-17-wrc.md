The WRc Innovation Day has been running now for 6 years and over that time has successfully grown from 90 attendees to a record 390 in 2017. Our brief was to deliver a focused and personalised event with quantifiable return on investment (ROI) for every attendee.

2017 marked 90 years of business for WRc so the strap line of 'Delivering Knowledge in a Relationship Economy' fitted perfectly and as the Innovation Day was also going to be the platform to launch the new WRc branding a step change was essential.

The event kicked off with a celebratory dinner recognising the vast experience WRc have shared with their customers and suppliers over the last 90 years. It was held at the extensive facilities of the WRc site where customers could network, relax with excellent food and wine and a musical accompaniment through the years from the Kaslin Quartet.

The following day was made up of an exhibition of 48 different companies across 3 sectors, a panel of keynote speakers and an afternoon of thought interactive workshops and so it was key that with so much going on, the messages didn’t get lost.

The solution we delivered brought technology to the event via a bespoke event app and RFID scanning to encourage networking and support the sustainability of WRc. The average attendee visited the app 27 times to see details on the speakers and attendees, read the workshop content, collect and view relevant documents and access the exhibition floor plan.

To ensure the ROI for the exhibitors, they were each given a tablet that recognised the RFID chip in the delegates name badges and during the event, 978 leads were captured and the top exhibitor walked away with 54 leads.

WRc have always been able to draw an audience to previous Innovation Day’s as the event has grown but we wanted to support that and reduce the risk of non-attendance and through pre-event registration and use of the event app, 80.5% of pre-registered delegates attended – a bar we are looking forward to raising in 2018.
